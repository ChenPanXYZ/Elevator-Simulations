"""CSC148 Assignment 1 - People and Elevators

=== CSC148 Fall 2018 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module description ===
This module contains classes for the two "basic" entities in this simulation:
people and elevators. We have provided basic outlines of these two classes
for you; you are responsible for implementing these two classes so that they
work with the rest of the simulation.

You may NOT change any existing attributes, or the interface for any public
methods we have provided. However, you can (and should) add new attributes,
and of course you'll have to implement the methods we've provided, as well
as add your own methods to complete this assignment.

Finally, note that Person and Elevator each inherit from a kind of sprite found
in sprites.py; this is to enable their instances to be visualized properly.
You may not change sprites.py, but are responsible for reading the documentation
to understand these classes, as well as the abstract methods your classes must
implement.
